        <h4><strong>Stickerizer</strong></h4>
        <a href="https://github.com/drudgesentinel/stickerizer">Stickerizer</a> allows someone on a UNIX based filesystem to create Telegram messenger compatible stickers from a folder of image files. I did this as a Ruby rewrite of a <a href="https://github.com/drudgesentinel/telegram_stickerizer">bash script</a> I wrote some time ago, though ironically the rewrite is both less lightweight and slower(but the code is of higher quality).

        <h4><strong>Vernacular</strong>: Openbox3 Theme</h4>
        I have written and modified existing themes for the old school Openbox window manager. The GTK (Gnome Toolkit) often used in Linux desktops uses CSS heavily. My theme is based on an old ArchLabs Linux theme, and is called <a href="https://github.com/drudgesentinel/vernacular">vernacular</a>.
